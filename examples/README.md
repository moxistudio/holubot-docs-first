# Examples

This folder contains the minimal public contract for custom agents.

## Files

- `agent.schema.yaml`: lightweight schema-style guidance for `agent.yaml`
- `standup_agent/agent.yaml`: minimal runnable-style example

## Goal

Help readers understand how HoluBot uses Skill/Agent definitions for dispatch and governance without requiring full code release.
